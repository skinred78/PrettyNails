  - Quality levels: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor
  - Actionable user feedback for image improvements

### Enhanced
- **ImageProcessingService.swift**
  - Added comprehensive image validation pipeline
  - Implemented quality analysis with scoring
  - Enhanced error handling with recovery suggestions
  - Added async/await patterns for smooth performance

- **ImageUtils.swift**
  - Extended with Vision framework capabilities
  - Added image enhancement and cropping functions
  - Implemented format detection and conversion
  - Added comprehensive validation functions

- **Error Handling System**

  - Comprehensive validation throughout the pipeline
  - Quality-based recommendations for image improvements

### Technical Improvements
- Async/await patterns for UI responsiveness
- Background processing for Vision framework operations
- Confidence-based filtering for accurate nail detection
- Memory optimization for large image processing
- Robust error recovery and user guidance

### Development Notes
- All business logic services are now fully implemented
- Vision framework integration tested and working
- Image processing pipeline handles various input qualities
- Ready for Phase 4: API Integration with Gemini
- Maintains clean separation between UI and business logic

## [Version 0.1.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added
- Complete SwiftUI UI layer implementation (Phase 2)
  - HomeView: Photo selection with camera/gallery options
  - PhotoCaptureView: Camera interface using UIImagePickerController
  - PhotoPickerView: Gallery selection using PHPickerViewController
  - NailDesignSelectionView: Grid layout with search and filtering
  - ProcessingView: Loading screen with progress animations
  - ResultView: Before/after comparison with save/share functionality
  - SettingsView: API configuration and app preferences
  - ContentView: TabView navigation connecting all views

- Asset catalog configuration
  - AppIcon set with all required iOS sizes (20pt to 1024pt)
  - AccentColor with light and dark mode variants
  - Proper asset catalog structure and Contents.json files

- Project configuration
  - CFBundleExecutable key in Info.plist for proper app installation
  - Camera and photo library usage descriptions
  - App Transport Security settings for Gemini API
  - Proper bundle identifier and app metadata

### Fixed
- Asset catalog build errors by correcting file paths
